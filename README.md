# 🚀 Address Book Management System

> A menu-driven contact management application written in C, demonstrating structured programming, modular design, and file-based data persistence.

---

## 🧠 Overview  
The **Address Book Management System** is a console-based application that allows users to efficiently manage contacts through a simple and interactive menu interface. The project is designed using modular programming principles, where each functionality is separated into different source files, making the code clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## ⚙️ Functionalities  

The application provides the following operations:

1. Add Contact  
2. Edit Contact  
3. Search Contact  
4. Delete Contact  
5. List Contacts  
6. Save & Exit  
7. Exit

- **Edit Contact** → Modify existing contact information  
- **Search Contact** → Find contacts using name or phone number  
- **Delete Contact** → Remove a contact from the system  
- **List Contacts** → Display all stored contacts  
- **Save & Exit** → Save data to file (`contact.txt`) and exit  
- **Exit** → Exit the program without saving

│── contact.c       # Contact operations (Add, Edit, Delete, etc.)  
│── populate.c      # Initialization logic  
│── contact.h       # Structure & function declarations

## 🔄 Program Flow  

Start Program  
↓  
Initialize Address Book  
↓  
Display Menu  
↓  
User selects option (1–7)  
↓  
Perform operation  
↓  
Repeat until Exit

## 🧩 Concepts Used  

- Structures (`struct AddressBook`)  
- File Handling (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`)  
- Modular Programming  
- Switch-case logic  
- String manipulation  

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Program starts and initializes the address book
2. User is shown a menu with available operations
3. Based on user input, corresponding function is executed:
   - Add → stores new contact
   - Edit → modifies existing contact
   - Search → retrieves contact details
   - Delete → removes contact
4. Data is stored in a file (`contact.txt`)
5. On selecting "Save & Exit", all data is written to file

## ▶️ How to Run  

```bash
gcc main.c contact.c populate.c -o address_book
./address_book
```
